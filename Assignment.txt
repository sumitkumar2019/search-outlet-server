Full Stack Developer - Practical Test : Honest Food Company



It is essential for Honest Food to be able to route incoming orders to the correct outlet depending on predefined delivery area polygons and the customer’s shipping address.


Develop an API which accepts a customer location as an input parameter and returns the correct outlet identifier for the input location.

Develop a frontend which allows a user to enter and submit an address and then displays the outlet identifier returned from the API.


You may use any freely available 3rd party geospatial services and/or open source components.

You should build your API with NodeJS and your frontend with any framework of your choice. 

Your deliverables should include the full source code and usage instructions.

In case your solution is incomplete or you are aware of any defects, add a detailed description about how your solution could be improved.

You have 4 hours to complete this task and submit your deliverables to milosha.faria@honestfoodcompany.de
